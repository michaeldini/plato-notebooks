# Plato-Notebooks

Read and illustrate Plato's texts with AI-generated images.

## Features

- Auto-generate jupyter notebooks of Plato texts.
- Notebooks feature the text and functions to generate an Ai image representing the text.

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Install the required packages in your environment via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [Add your OpenAi API key to the environment](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)
- `python main.py <title>` command to generate a notebook for the text.
- `python main.py titles` command to list all available texts.

## Example

```bash
python main.py "Apology"
```

```bash
python main.py titles
```

Check out Apology.ipynb for an example notebook generated from the text "Apology" by Plato.

## Pipeline

- Download .txt files from Project Gutenberg
- Edit the text files to remove the header and footer, and format for easier parsing (ie. remove line breaks)
- user runs `python main.py <TITLE>` to generate the notebook.
- `main.py` is the main script that generates the notebooks. It takes one argument, title. It runs `parse_texts.ipynb` to parse the text files and generate pickle files for every text. It then, uses  `generate_notebook.py` to generate the notebook for the given title. The notebook is saved to the notebooks folder and is ready to be opened in Jupyter.
- The user can then open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to generate the images. The images are saved in the images folder.
- The user can then run the following code to convert the notebook to HTML. The HTML file will contain the text and the images generated by the AI.

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --embed-images  --no-input --theme dark <TITLE>.ipynb
```

### Details

`parse_texts.ipynb` is a script that parses the text files and generates a list of strings. The list is saved as a pickle file. The elements in the list are the paragraphs of the text, dialogue pairs, or whatever is appropriate. The list can be used to generate the notebook.

The file is a notebook because it useful to see the parsed text and iterate in a notebook when developing the correct parsing function. With the limited number of texts, it is not worth the effort to make it a more robust script. (FUTURE)

The output of this script is the creation of pickle files for each text.

`inspect.ipynb` is a script that loads the pickle files for inspection.

## Future

-move generated_imge func to utils.py

- CLI
- reduce image file size. two folders compressed and uncompressed.
- add more texts
- templates
- pypi
- other image APIs
