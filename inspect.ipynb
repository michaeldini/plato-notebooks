      "his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison, but no\n",
      "one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, and it\n",
      "is a long time since any stranger from Athens has found his way hither;\n",
      "so that we had no clear account.\n",
      "PHAEDO: Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?\n",
      "ECHECRATES: Yes; some one told us about the trial, and we could not\n",
      "understand why, having been condemned, he should have been put to death,\n",
      "not at the time, but long afterwards. What was the reason of this?\n",

      "ECHECRATES: What is this ship?\n",
      "PHAEDO: It is the ship in which, according to Athenian tradition,\n",
      "Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was\n",
      "the saviour of them and of himself. And they were said to have vowed\n",
      "to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly\n",
      "mission to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the whole period\n",
      "of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo\n",
      "crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is\n",
      "not allowed to be polluted by public executions; and when the vessel\n",
      "is detained by contrary winds, the time spent in going and returning\n",
      "is very considerable. As I was saying, the ship was crowned on the day\n",
      "before the trial, and this was the reason why Socrates lay in prison and\n",
      "was not put to death until long after he was condemned.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: What was the manner of his death, Phaedo? What was said or\n",
      "done? And which of his friends were with him? Or did the authorities\n",
      "forbid them to be present--so that he had no friends near him when he\n",
      "died?\n",
      "PHAEDO: No; there were several of them with him.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me\n",

      "PHAEDO: I have nothing at all to do, and will try to gratify your wish.\n",

      "PHAEDO: I had a singular feeling at being in his company. For I\n",
      "could hardly believe that I was present at the death of a friend, and\n",
      "therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; he died so fearlessly, and\n",
      "his words and bearing were so noble and gracious, that to me he appeared\n",
      "blessed. I thought that in going to the other world he could not be\n",
      "without a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever was,\n",
      "when he arrived there, and therefore I did not pity him as might have\n",
      "seemed natural at such an hour. But I had not the pleasure which I\n",
      "usually feel in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme\n",
      "of which we spoke). I was pleased, but in the pleasure there was also a\n",
      "strange admixture of pain; for I reflected that he was soon to die, and\n",
      "this double feeling was shared by us all; we were laughing and weeping\n",
      "by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus--you know the sort of\n",
      "man?\n",
      "ECHECRATES: Yes.\n",
      "PHAEDO: He was quite beside himself; and I and all of us were greatly\n",

      "ECHECRATES: Who were present?\n",
      "PHAEDO: Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus, Critobulus\n",

      "likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus, and some others;\n",
      "Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: Were there any strangers?\n",
      "PHAEDO: Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and Phaedondes;\n",
      "Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?\n",
      "PHAEDO: No, they were said to be in Aegina.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: Any one else?\n",
      "PHAEDO: I think that these were nearly all.\n",
      "ECHECRATES: Well, and what did you talk about?\n",
      "PHAEDO: I will begin at the beginning, and endeavour to repeat the\n",
      "entire conversation. On the previous days we had been in the habit of\n",
      "assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial took\n",
      "place, and which is not far from the prison. There we used to wait\n",
      "talking with one another until the opening of the doors (for they were\n",
      "not opened very early); then we went in and generally passed the day\n",
      "with Socrates. On the last morning we assembled sooner than usual,\n",
      "having heard on the day before when we quitted the prison in the evening\n",
      "that the sacred ship had come from Delos, and so we arranged to meet\n",
      "very early at the accustomed place. On our arrival the jailer who\n",
      "answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and told us to stay\n",
      "until he called us. 'For the Eleven,' he said, 'are now with Socrates;\n",
      "they are taking off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die\n",
      "to-day.' He soon returned and said that we might come in. On entering we\n",
      "found Socrates just released from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know,\n",
      "sitting by him, and holding his child in her arms. When she saw us she\n",
      "uttered a cry and said, as women will: 'O Socrates, this is the last\n",
      "time that either you will converse with your friends, or they with you.'\n",
      "Socrates turned to Crito and said: 'Crito, let some one take her home.'\n",
      "Some of Crito's people accordingly led her away, crying out and beating\n",
      "herself. And when she was gone, Socrates, sitting up on the couch, bent\n",
      "and rubbed his leg, saying, as he was rubbing: How singular is the\n",
      "thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be\n",
      "thought to be the opposite of it; for they are never present to a man at\n",
      "the same instant, and yet he who pursues either is generally compelled\n",
      "to take the other; their bodies are two, but they are joined by a single\n",
      "head. And I cannot help thinking that if Aesop had remembered them, he\n",
      "would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife, and\n",
      "how, when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is\n",
      "the reason why when one comes the other follows, as I know by my own\n",
      "experience now, when after the pain in my leg which was caused by the\n",
      "chain pleasure appears to succeed.\n",
      "Upon this Cebes said: I am glad, Socrates, that you have mentioned the\n",
      "name of Aesop. For it reminds me of a question which has been asked by\n",
      "many, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by Evenus the\n",
      "poet--he will be sure to ask it again, and therefore if you would like\n",
      "me to have an answer ready for him, you may as well tell me what I\n",
      "should say to him:--he wanted to know why you, who never before wrote\n",
      "a line of poetry, now that you are in prison are turning Aesop's fables\n",
      "into verse, and also composing that hymn in honour of Apollo.\n",
      "Tell him, Cebes, he replied, what is the truth--that I had no idea of\n",
      "rivalling him or his poems; to do so, as I knew, would be no easy task.\n",
      "But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I felt\n",
      "about the meaning of certain dreams. In the course of my life I have\n",
      "often had intimations in dreams 'that I should compose music.' The same\n",
      "dream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but\n",
      "always saying the same or nearly the same words: 'Cultivate and make\n",
      "music,' said the dream. And hitherto I had imagined that this was only\n",
      "intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy, which\n",
      "has been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and best of music.\n",
      "The dream was bidding me do what I was already doing, in the same way\n",
      "that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he\n",
      "is already running. But I was not certain of this, for the dream might\n",
      "have meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under\n",
      "sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that\n",
      "it would be safer for me to satisfy the scruple, and, in obedience to\n",
      "the dream, to compose a few verses before I departed. And first I made\n",
      "a hymn in honour of the god of the festival, and then considering that a\n",
      "poet, if he is really to be a poet, should not only put together words,\n",
      "but should invent stories, and that I have no invention, I took some\n",
      "fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and which I knew--they were\n",
      "the first I came upon--and turned them into verse. Tell this to Evenus,\n",
      "Cebes, and bid him be of good cheer; say that I would have him come\n",
      "after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I am likely\n",
      "to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.\n",
      "Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a frequent\n",
      "companion of his I should say that, as far as I know him, he will never\n",
      "take your advice unless he is obliged. Why, said Socrates,--is not Evenus a philosopher? I think that he is, said Simmias.\n",
      "Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to\n",
      "die, but he will not take his own life, for that is held to be unlawful. Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on to the\n",
      "ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting. Why do you say, enquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his own\n",
      "life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying? Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are the disciples\n",
      "of Philolaus, never heard him speak of this? Yes, but his language was obscure, Socrates.\n",
      "My words, too, are only an echo; but there is no reason why I should not\n",
      "repeat what I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place,\n",
      "it is very meet for me to be thinking and talking of the nature of\n",
      "the pilgrimage which I am about to make. What can I do better in the\n",
      "interval between this and the setting of the sun?\n",
      "Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held to be unlawful? as I have\n",
      "certainly heard Philolaus, about whom you were just now asking, affirm\n",
      "when he was staying with us at Thebes: and there are others who say the\n",
      "same, although I have never understood what was meant by any of them.\n",
      "Do not lose heart, replied Socrates, and the day may come when you will\n",
      "understand. I suppose that you wonder why, when other things which are\n",
      "evil may be good at certain times and to certain persons, death is to\n",
      "be the only exception, and why, when a man is better dead, he is not\n",
      "permitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of\n",
      "another. Very true, said Cebes, laughing gently and speaking in his native\n",
      "Boeotian.\n",
      "I admit the appearance of inconsistency in what I am saying; but\n",
      "there may not be any real inconsistency after all. There is a doctrine\n",
      "whispered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open\n",
      "the door and run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite\n",
      "understand. Yet I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that\n",
      "we are a possession of theirs. Do you not agree? Yes, I quite agree, said Cebes.\n",
      "And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example, took\n",
      "the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no\n",
      "intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with\n",
      "him, and would you not punish him if you could? Certainly, replied Cebes.\n",
      "Then, if we look at the matter thus, there may be reason in saying that\n",
      "a man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him, as\n",
      "he is now summoning me.\n",
      "Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there seems to be truth in what you say. And\n",
      "yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our\n",
      "guardian and we his possessions, with the willingness to die which we\n",
      "were just now attributing to the philosopher? That the wisest of men\n",
      "should be willing to leave a service in which they are ruled by the gods\n",
      "who are the best of rulers, is not reasonable; for surely no wise man\n",
      "thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than\n",
      "the gods take of him. A fool may perhaps think so--he may argue that he\n",
      "had better run away from his master, not considering that his duty is\n",
      "to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there\n",
      "would be no sense in his running away. The wise man will want to be ever\n",
      "with him who is better than himself. Now this, Socrates, is the reverse\n",
      "of what was just now said; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow\n",
      "and the fool rejoice at passing out of life.\n",
      "The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said he,\n",
      "turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not so easily\n",
      "convinced by the first thing which he hears.\n",
      "And certainly, added Simmias, the objection which he is now making does\n",
      "appear to me to have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly\n",
      "wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better\n",
      "than himself? And I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he\n",
      "thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the\n",
      "gods whom you acknowledge to be our good masters. Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in what you say. And so you think\n",
      "that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court? We should like you to do so, said Simmias.\n",
      "Then I must try to make a more successful defence before you than I\n",
      "did when before the judges. For I am quite ready to admit, Simmias and\n",
      "Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded in\n",
      "the first place that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of\n",
      "which I am as certain as I can be of any such matters), and secondly\n",
      "(though I am not so sure of this last) to men departed, better than\n",
      "those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do not grieve as I might have\n",
      "done, for I have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the\n",
      "dead, and as has been said of old, some far better thing for the good\n",
      "than for the evil.\n",
      "But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates? said\n",
      "Simmias. Will you not impart them to us?--for they are a benefit\n",
      "in which we too are entitled to share. Moreover, if you succeed in\n",
      "convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself. I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me hear what\n",
      "Crito wants; he has long been wishing to say something to me.\n",
      "Only this, Socrates, replied Crito:--the attendant who is to give you\n",
      "the poison has been telling me, and he wants me to tell you, that you\n",
      "are not to talk much, talking, he says, increases heat, and this is\n",
      "apt to interfere with the action of the poison; persons who excite\n",
      "themselves are sometimes obliged to take a second or even a third dose. Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give\n",
      "the poison twice or even thrice if necessary; that is all. I knew quite well what you would say, replied Crito; but I was obliged\n",
      "to satisfy him. Never mind him, he said.\n",
      "And now, O my judges, I desire to prove to you that the real philosopher\n",
      "has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after\n",
      "death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world. And\n",
      "how this may be, Simmias and Cebes, I will endeavour to explain. For I\n",
      "deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood\n",
      "by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and\n",
      "dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his\n",
      "life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has\n",
      "been always pursuing and desiring?\n",
      "Simmias said laughingly: Though not in a laughing humour, you have made\n",
      "me laugh, Socrates; for I cannot help thinking that the many when they\n",
      "hear your words will say how truly you have described philosophers, and\n",
      "our people at home will likewise say that the life which philosophers\n",
      "desire is in reality death, and that they have found them out to be\n",
      "deserving of the death which they desire.\n",
      "And they are right, Simmias, in thinking so, with the exception of the\n",
      "words 'they have found them out'; for they have not found out either\n",
      "what is the nature of that death which the true philosopher deserves,\n",
      "or how he deserves or desires death. But enough of them:--let us discuss\n",
      "the matter among ourselves: Do we believe that there is such a thing as\n",
      "death? To be sure, replied Simmias.\n",
      "Is it not the separation of soul and body? And to be dead is the\n",
      "completion of this; when the soul exists in herself, and is released\n",
      "from the body and the body is released from the soul, what is this but\n",
      "death? Just so, he replied.\n",
      "There is another question, which will probably throw light on our\n",
      "present inquiry if you and I can agree about it:--Ought the philosopher\n",
      "to care about the pleasures--if they are to be called pleasures--of\n",
      "eating and drinking? Certainly not, answered Simmias. And what about the pleasures of love--should he care for them? By no means.\n",
      "And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body, for\n",
      "example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other\n",
      "adornments of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not rather\n",
      "despise anything more than nature needs? What do you say? I should say that the true philosopher would despise them.\n",
      "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not\n",
      "with the body? He would like, as far as he can, to get away from the\n",
      "body and to turn to the soul. Quite true.\n",
      "In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be\n",
      "observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the communion of\n",
      "the body. Very true.\n",
      "Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who\n",
      "has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not\n",
      "worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as\n",
      "dead. That is also true.\n",
      "What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?--is the\n",
      "body, if invited to share in the enquiry, a hinderer or a helper? I mean\n",
      "to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? Are they not, as the\n",
      "poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? and yet, if even\n",
      "they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other\n",
      "senses?--for you will allow that they are the best of them? Certainly, he replied. Then when does the soul attain truth?--for in attempting to consider\n",
      "anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived. True. Then must not true existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all? Yes.\n",
      "And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of\n",
      "these things trouble her--neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any\n",
      "pleasure,--when she takes leave of the body, and has as little as\n",
      "possible to do with it, when she has no bodily sense or desire, but is\n",
      "aspiring after true being? Certainly. And in this the philosopher dishonours the body; his soul runs away from\n",
      "his body and desires to be alone and by herself? That is true. Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there not an\n",
      "absolute justice? Assuredly there is. And an absolute beauty and absolute good? Of course. But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes? Certainly not.\n",
      "Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense?--and I speak not\n",
      "of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength,\n",
      "and of the essence or true nature of everything. Has the reality of them\n",
      "ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? or rather, is not\n",
      "the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made\n",
      "by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact\n",
      "conception of the essence of each thing which he considers? Certainly.\n",
      "And he attains to the purest knowledge of them who goes to each with the\n",
      "mind alone, not introducing or intruding in the act of thought sight\n",
      "or any other sense together with reason, but with the very light of the\n",
      "mind in her own clearness searches into the very truth of each; he who\n",
      "has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the\n",
      "whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements which when\n",
      "they infect the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge--who,\n",
      "if not he, is likely to attain the knowledge of true being? What you say has a wonderful truth in it, Socrates, replied Simmias.\n",
      "And when real philosophers consider all these things, will they not be\n",
      "led to make a reflection which they will express in words something like\n",
      "the following? 'Have we not found,' they will say, 'a path of thought\n",
      "which seems to bring us and our argument to the conclusion, that while\n",
      "we are in the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the\n",
      "body, our desire will not be satisfied? and our desire is of the truth.\n",
      "For the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere\n",
      "requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and\n",
      "impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and\n",
      "lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and\n",
      "in fact, as men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all.\n",
      "Whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence but from the body\n",
      "and the lusts of the body? wars are occasioned by the love of money, and\n",
      "money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body;\n",
      "and by reason of all these impediments we have no time to give to\n",
      "philosophy; and, last and worst of all, even if we are at leisure and\n",
      "betake ourselves to some speculation, the body is always breaking in\n",
      "upon us, causing turmoil and confusion in our enquiries, and so amazing\n",
      "us that we are prevented from seeing the truth. It has been proved to us\n",
      "by experience that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we\n",
      "must be quit of the body--the soul in herself must behold things in\n",
      "themselves: and then we shall attain the wisdom which we desire, and of\n",
      "which we say that we are lovers, not while we live, but after death; for\n",
      "if while in company with the body, the soul cannot have pure knowledge,\n",
      "one of two things follows--either knowledge is not to be attained at\n",
      "all, or, if at all, after death. For then, and not till then, the soul\n",
      "will be parted from the body and exist in herself alone. In this present\n",
      "life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we\n",
      "have the least possible intercourse or communion with the body, and are\n",
      "not surfeited with the bodily nature, but keep ourselves pure until the\n",
      "hour when God himself is pleased to release us. And thus having got rid\n",
      "of the foolishness of the body we shall be pure and hold converse with\n",
      "the pure, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere, which is\n",
      "no other than the light of truth.' For the impure are not permitted to\n",
      "approach the pure. These are the sort of words, Simmias, which the true\n",
      "lovers of knowledge cannot help saying to one another, and thinking. You\n",
      "would agree; would you not? Undoubtedly, Socrates.\n",
      "But, O my friend, if this is true, there is great reason to hope that,\n",
      "going whither I go, when I have come to the end of my journey, I shall\n",
      "attain that which has been the pursuit of my life. And therefore I go on\n",
      "my way rejoicing, and not I only, but every other man who believes that\n",
      "his mind has been made ready and that he is in a manner purified. Certainly, replied Simmias.\n",
      "And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body,\n",
      "as I was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting\n",
      "herself into herself from all sides out of the body; the dwelling in\n",
      "her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as she\n",
      "can;--the release of the soul from the chains of the body? Very true, he said. And this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed\n",
      "death? To be sure, he said.\n",
      "And the true philosophers, and they only, are ever seeking to release\n",
      "the soul. Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body\n",
      "their especial study? That is true.\n",
      "And, as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction\n",
      "in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and\n",
      "yet repining when it comes upon them. Clearly.\n",
      "And the true philosophers, Simmias, are always occupied in the practice\n",
      "of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.\n",
      "Look at the matter thus:--if they have been in every way the enemies of\n",
      "the body, and are wanting to be alone with the soul, when this desire of\n",
      "theirs is granted, how inconsistent would they be if they trembled and\n",
      "repined, instead of rejoicing at their departure to that place where,\n",
      "when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they desired--and\n",
      "this was wisdom--and at the same time to be rid of the company of their\n",
      "enemy. Many a man has been willing to go to the world below animated\n",
      "by the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and\n",
      "conversing with them. And will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is\n",
      "strongly persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can\n",
      "worthily enjoy her, still repine at death? Will he not depart with joy?\n",
      "Surely he will, O my friend, if he be a true philosopher. For he will\n",
      "have a firm conviction that there and there only, he can find wisdom\n",
      "in her purity. And if this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was\n",
      "saying, if he were afraid of death. He would, indeed, replied Simmias.\n",
      "And when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death, is not\n",
      "his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom, but\n",
      "a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover of either\n",
      "money or power, or both? Quite so, he replied. And is not courage, Simmias, a quality which is specially characteristic\n",
      "of the philosopher? Certainly.\n",
      "There is temperance again, which even by the vulgar is supposed to\n",
      "consist in the control and regulation of the passions, and in the sense\n",
      "of superiority to them--is not temperance a virtue belonging to those\n",
      "only who despise the body, and who pass their lives in philosophy? Most assuredly. For the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider them,\n",
      "are really a contradiction. How so? Well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in general as\n",
      "a great evil. Very true, he said. And do not courageous men face death because they are afraid of yet\n",
      "greater evils? That is quite true.\n"
